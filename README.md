# Churn_Prediction_Model_(ann)




Churn prediction consists of detecting which customers are likely to cancel a subscription to a service based on how they use the service.


Step how to predict churn. The process is as follows:

- Gather historical customer data that you save to a CSV file.
- Upload that data to a prediction service that automatically creates a “predictive model.”
- Use the model on each current customer to predict whether they are at risk of leaving.
